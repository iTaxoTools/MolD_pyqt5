The Pyqt5-Mold project adds a GUI (graphical user interface) - a Python implementation of DNA diagnoses for pre-defined taxa
Fedosov A.E., Achaz G., Puillandre N. 2019. Revisiting use of DNA characters in taxonomy with
MolD ‚Äê a tree independent algorithm to retrieve diagnostic nucleotide characters from
monolocus datasets. BioRxiv. DOI: 10.1101/838151 )
The MolD algorithm is divided into five consecutive steps. At first step sequences are sorted by
taxon (as defined by the column 2 of the input) and the positions conserved within each taxon
are identified.



# How to use it

* To open it as the original commandline tool; please type python MolD_sDNCFASTA.py and follow along the instructions.

* To use it as GUI tool; Please type python mold.py on your terminal and follow the instructions.
